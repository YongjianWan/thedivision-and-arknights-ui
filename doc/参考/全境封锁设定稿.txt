Tom Clancy's The Division — Art & UI Style Guide

AGENTS
The modern world is a house of cards. Remove one and everything falls apart.
The virus struck the city only days ago. Black Friday, they called it. And society collapsed almost immediately.
The Strategic Homeland Division is an autonomous unit of sleeper agents who lead apparently ordinary lives until they are needed. They are trained to operate independently in order to take back the streets.
When society falls, they rise.

FOREWORD
We work in the most amazing of mediums. We create virtual worlds that the gamers can enter and live through an emotional, immersive journey where they are the real Hero. It's such an unbelievable joy to see a gamer exploring one of the digital dreams we have lovingly crafted, often over the course of many, many years, in a studio filled with concentrated artists and engineers, collaborating late into the night in the pale, blue light of an army of computer screens.
But before there is a game, we must dream about the dream itself. We talk and we brainstorm. We use references and discuss what we like and what we don't. Looking at the real world, we research life, nature, and history. We read and we think on our own, and come back the next day with a rich bouquet of ideas that we share with each other. All to shape the virtual world in our minds before it exists — the dream will become reality when gamers can enter into it and act as they will.
Before we write the millions of lines of code that is the hidden skeleton of a game, we often start with images — we make pictures. Because when you think of it, ideas are like images, a wordless mix of color, composition, pace, mood and emotion. First there are some quick strokes, ingredients. Then, after discussing the sketches intensely, we add more details, and embark on a patient visual exploration that reveals so many things about the game — what we meant to say — until we see the right image. And we discover that those pictures contain hidden gems and pleasant surprises even for ourselves.
This is what concept art is about.
It is the challenge of expressing the shapeless dream, it is the craft of defining that which is currently without a comprehensive semantic. Thank god then, that we have been blessed with such an abundance of talented artists on Tom Clancy's The Division! From studios based in Sweden, England, France and the US, there have been passionate concept artists working day in and day out to carve out one answer after another. A street, an agent, a frightened civilian, a society collapsing, abandoned cars, dogs and wildlife, enemies preparing an ambush, majestic buildings... And then: Weather, color palettes, smoke, light, effects, particles, player skills, loot, tunes, and key art. And so it goes on! We plaster the walls of the studio with art and images. We walk among them as if in a matrix of some magic yet to appear. As we live our days among those pictures, the game is tenderly guided and protected by the simple fact that an image says more than a thousand words — and they make sure we subconsciously share the same dream.
We hope you will enjoy this book as much as we do on the team of Tom Clancy's The Division! Immense admiration for your craftsmanship!
— David Polfeldt, Managing Director, Massive Entertainment | a Ubisoft Studio

CONCEPT ART
Agent Design
Casual attire gives way to a harder aesthetic. "You can change your gear and vanity items to look very civilian or very military," begins Lead Concept Artist Tom Garden. "These items are identical for male and female characters, and this was important for us to create a more gender neutral choice for players."
"We did a lot of exploration on what became the SHD agents," says Brand Art Director Rodrigo Cortes. "Some iterations were more military, some looked very sci-fi, but we settled on a civilian look very quickly." Equipment and armor are designed to deal with a variety of combat and emergency scenarios.
Faye Lau
Battered, broken and yet unbowed. Surviving the chaos takes its toll in real time and with varying degrees of damage. This agent is still lucky enough to be classified as walking wounded. "Faye is a Division agent like the player character, however an incident incapacitates her and leaves her to run things from behind a desk, much to her chagrin," says Tom Garden. "We wanted to make sure that, post-injury, she still looked ready to hop back into action. She keeps her vest and sidearm equipped, and has hooked her SHADE computer to her belt. She'll support you over the comms, but cannot wait to get a slice of the action herself."
SHD Tech — Watch & Contact Lenses
Coordination and effective communication are the keystones of successful operations. The SHD agent's wristwatch and other personal accoutrements are well up to the task of keeping the team together. "The watch is a natural evolution of the smart phone," says Rodrigo Cortes. "The great thing for our agent is that it can be worn both in civilian life and on the job without drawing much attention. Even the contact lenses, which display the information for the agents, are based on existing prototype technology. Coupled with augmented reality it becomes a true force-multiplier with countless applications and areas of use."
Robust form follows rugged function. The design team's dedication to making even the smallest details of gameplay tangible, practical and grounded in real-world technologies is evident. The orange ring is a sign of unity on both the watch and backpack computer.

SHADE Computer & Backpack
As an ostensibly covert cell, Division agents have no formal base of operations and must carry a lot of their equipment with them, including a lot of specialized gear. One of the more iconic pieces is the SHADE computer which is hooked onto their backpacks.
The team designed a Rappelling Tool for the agents; it allows them to quickly ascend and descend climbable ropes in the game. This is essential for speed and maneuverability in a city of skyscrapers.
Agent Load-Out
A fully-laden Division agent is a self-contained and battle-ready combat unit. Lead Concept Artist Tom Garden dives into the detail: "We have six gear carrying slots and six vanity slots on the character. This allows for a lot of personalization and customization, not only in terms of gameplay but also how you will look. You also have the option to take off hats, scarves or jackets if you wish. For your gear, as you level up the aesthetics will look much cooler and you will gain a more tactical silhouette with more thigh rigging, bags and protective armor."
Division agents are neither reactionary vigilantes nor fearful survivalists, but must still be ready to react to any number of situations at a moment's notice. The backpack is an iconic part of the agents. The art team took inspiration from military contractors, 'preppers' and go-bags for the visual aesthetics. As the players level, the bags will evolve and gain new accessories. The artists also included a visual representation of each skill item active on the bag, as well as on the face mask.
Agent Skills & Equipment
Strobes and mines are designed to make life difficult for adversaries of any variety. The Firefly delivers blinding flashes that incapacitate an opponent long enough for an agent to gain a more lethal advantage. Hotspot and Distraction mines may create a more lasting impression. "The player has many skills at their disposal as they level up," says Tom Garden. "We went through many ideas before settling on the final group of skills. It was a balancing act to make them feel grounded in reality, but fun and rewarding in terms of gameplay and visuals."
Agent Appearance Variations
SHD agents should dress properly for the task at hand and the prevailing weather conditions. The art team developed a variety of looks for the agents which are possible by simply playing around with different combinations of items. One key item that can change is the look of the player's jacket. Players can choose to wear the jacket or remove it to reveal a Body Vest.
Agent Realism
The steely gaze of this agent as he focuses on his target indicates both his grim determination and the tremendous skill of the artists in conveying the scene in such convincing and utterly lifelike detail. The vivid reflection in his eyes, the shine on his nose and pores of his skin shows that the artists have ventured far beyond the uncanny valley. Realism in the game is an important factor to the team when creating the look of the agents. Having high resolution marketing art and renders helped to reach that goal within the playable game.

ECHOS
Certain events of the outbreak can be replayed in short segments and a spectral orange hue. ECHO is a tool that allows agents to analyze their environments by assembling data from a range of sources. It is a useful resource for any agent to trace hostile movements, missing persons or hidden caches of supplies and equipment.
A traumatic scene is reviewed through the prism of the ECHO system. There are many like it, and most are difficult to witness. However, important gameplay details may reveal themselves on close examination. Lead Concept Artist Tom Garden explains further: "An important aspect in the creation of ECHOs was to communicate the differences between real-world elements and ECHO elements. A withered real world plant might reveal its sprightly self once the ECHO is activated, to give a sense of passing time. Special attention was paid to the small details in the environment. Seemingly trivial things, such as an overturned picture frame or an ECHO flashlight differing slightly from its real-world position, may prove to be important clues in your investigations. Make sure to keep a look out for these irregularities!"
"When game development is at its most fun, it is an organic and collaborative process between multiple disciplines. Someone has a need or a problem and others chip in to solve it. The ECHO is an example of such a thing," adds Rodrigo Cortes. "Essentially driven by a narrative need, it is a collaborative effort between code, design, UI and writers. The basic need was to find a way to relay information from the past without disrupting the cooperative experience for the player. Not wanting to lock people into cut-scenes or risk members of the player group missing what happened, the ECHO was suggested as a possible solution. It was however a new challenge, so it required insight and help from multiple experts. Like many other features created through iterative design, it has blossomed over time into its current form."

Motion & Animation / Menu Systems


1. Core Pillars
Simplicity
UI should be minimal, to enhance clarity and minimize screen space. Removing all unnecessary decorative elements and emphasizing a clear focal point will enhance understanding of UI schemes. Simple geometric shapes and clean lines will enhance clarity and legibility for small icons and symbols. Finding alternatives to using text when possible will push the UI to convey information spatially and in more intuitive ways.

See: Visual Ingredients (shape, hierarchy, focal point) and Iconography Style

Directly Understandable
It should be effortless for the player to find, read and process important information presented by the UI. Relevant and important information should always be available and clearly discernible by the player, at a distance, and in various lighting conditions.

See: Legibility Standards

Functionality
Each UI element should serve and convey its designed purpose in a clear manner. For example, a map's primary purpose is to aid the player in navigating the world. If the map fails to do so, the UI element has failed.
Consistency
The navigation and interaction between different UI elements should be coherent in terms of input bindings, art and feedback. The UI should make the player feel at home in possibly big, complex and unexplored systems, adhering to the same interaction schemes of fewest possible interactions.

See: Animation (temporary and persistent states)

Diagetic
UI to the furthest extent possible is to be presented in world. This is to keep the player's conscious mind in the game world, incorporating all UI seamlessly in the experience. UI elements should be presented in such a way that it appears that the player character is aware and interacting with it. UI is to be used both to convey vital information to the player, and as a visual effect to enhance the experience and give it context to the game narrative.
Immersion

"Immersion is the final goal for developing a unique, memorable experience within The Division."

Immersion is maximized by reducing the perception outside the current focus area. This focus is achieved by following the UI design pillars, integrating UI into the game world, and developing intuitive and logical designs will create the most immersed game experience.

2. Defining the UI
2.1 Diagetic User Interface
Meta User Interface
The Division aims to minimize 'meta' UI, or UI that looks to appear on the 2D HUD plane like a traditional HUD. Meta UI also includes full screen effects, damage indication, and offscreen markers.
Spatial User Interface
User Interface that sits in 3D within the game world, such as button icons, help prompts, or player stats, are considered Spatial UI. These UI elements are in 3D, but sit outside the game narrative, and remind the player of the 'game'.
Diagetic UI
The goal for the Division UI is to develop a completely Diagetic User Interface experience within the game world, relating to the player character. Diagetic interface is in context to the game story, and spatially positioned in the game world, aiming to keep the player fully engaged in the fiction of the universe.

It is the aim of this style guide to encourage all UI to be Diagetic by bringing the UI into context as an operating system used by The Division Shades.

2.2 Thinking in Volumes
Traditional UI stems from Graphic Design principles which evolved for the 2-dimensional page. Working in 3 dimensions means utilizing z-depth with purpose to enhance 2D understanding.
Incorporation of Z-Depth
Proper use of z-depth¹ can greatly enhance understanding and focus. Another strength of volumetric design is in the ability to interact with a space and the objects within it, reducing the difficulty of relating information to the game world.
Ensuring Legibility
When overused, moving too many elements in z-depth can reduce legibility and break apart the grid. Overlapping of transparent objects should also be avoided as it creates unwanted clutter. 'Stacking' however, when legibility is not a concern, can demonstrate an accumulation or list.

¹ Z-Depth — The third dimension formed when a 2-dimensional space is pushed towards or away from the viewer.


3. Defining the Tech
3.1 What is the OS?
The operating system behind the SHADE tech is designed to be a constant companion, with a careful overview of the environment and the safety of its user.
The MYSTECH OS is constantly interacting and gathering information from the environment, giving the appearance of seamless integration with the world. By momentarily adding visual information to the environment, the OS enhances the user's understanding and interaction with the environment, augmenting one's reality.

¹ Shades — The covert operatives within the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), tasked with investigating the outbreak following Black Friday.
² Mys — (n) Swedish. An informal word for 'cosiness, care and comfort'.

MYSTECH OS — AUGMENTING REALITY

Logo: Points and Lines are the most basic visual ingredient, reflecting the binary aspect of digital data.
Tagline: The OS is augmenting one's ability to comprehend and interact with the immediate environment.

3.2 Where is the OS?
The SHADE Gear
The Division Operatives are fitted with a range of equipment to prepare them for adverse situations. The parts relative to the OS, which can be starting points or links with the world around them, are the Wrist Watch and Shoulder Ring.
The Iris Display
The UI is visualised through Retinal Display technology worn by the SHADE Operatives. With the ocular enhancement, operatives can see interfaces projected in perspective, and integrated into the world around them.

4. Defining the Style
4.1 Program-Generated Design

Mathematical · Non-organic · Spatial · Flexible

Program-generated Design can describe the visualization of digital information. Standard practice for programming applies in order to make software run quickly and be adaptable, which requires simplification and the use of generative systems to visualize complex systems.
How does a computer program visualize an area or object?
Design schemes should be mathematical, based on simple shapes and volumes: lines and points building areas and showing directions.
Since the OS is generating graphics 'on the fly' based on situational information, the style treatment should look simple. This also lends to the style's flexibility: the designs should function in any situation and lighting.
4.2 Behaviour Infographics

Light & Airy · Behavioural · Precise · Basic

Engineering schematics often use lines to demonstrate behavioural and range of motion. Rather than defining shape and volume, the style of the OS is brought to a more basic level, demonstrating motion and action. The result is a light and airy schematic that describes behavior.
How would a mechanical arm be visualized using the OS style of behavioural infographics?
This precise and mechanical style is combined with the care of an artist to create clear hierarchy and focus by adding weight, and varying opacities. The resulting 'infographics' should quickly and clearly reveal important information to the character without visually obstructing the environment.
4.3 Imperfect Software

Momentary · Sequential · Glitch · Imperfect

The MYSTECH OS was rushed into use, released mid-development in response to the events in Manhattan.
Though the OS should not be capable of defining and tracing complex and organic shapes, it instead renders approximations based on simple shapes and lines. It can notice motion and extrapolate direction, but it should never be visually perfect.

"The world within The Division is broken, and because of this, so is the technology."

Sequential animation should make it appear as if information is loading rather than instantly popping on-screen. This momentary 'glitching' is visible when UI appears and disappears, and sometimes the tech is disabled or interfered with.
Chromatic aberration is a visual effect applied to the screen as a whole to create a sense of 'glitching' on the Lens interface.

NOTE: Since the UI is not generated by holographic light, there should be no glow effect.


The DARPA Shader fragments text as it appears on screen.


5. The Visual Ingredients
5.1 Points, Lines & Shapes
Points and lines serve three key purposes:

Define shapes that are light & airy
Reinforce a navigation pathway
Guide the eye through animation

Points and lines can define areas and objects without cluttering visibility. They can connect a beginning to an endpoint to reinforce navigation, and can guide the eye through sequential animation.
For this reason, the visual language behind the MYSTECH OS is predominantly points and lines, reflecting both the binary form of digital data, and the node-based system from which the game UI is built.
A point defines a location, object, or moment in time. It is a 'node' which holds a value and carries information: a beginning and an endpoint.
A line defines a motion, space or distance. It represents transmission, action and direction: a connection between points.

6. Colors & Opacities
6.1 Warm vs Cool: Primary Colors

"The Shades represent warmth and hope against the backdrop of a cool and desolate Manhattan."

The visual environment of Manhattan is predominantly cold and cool, taking place in the snowy winter months. The Shades represent a sense of warmth and hope, which is embodied in the vibrant orange ring.
Primary Colors — Orange & White
Orange and white are the primary colors for the majority of the UI. White represents the neutral state, and orange represents the highlighted state and is to be used sparingly to create focus.

6.2 Secondary Colors

"Secondary colors, when used sparingly, can bring context and draw attention to an element or action."

The secondary colors can bring information into context by highlighting it as positive or negative. The secondary colors are also applied to health bars to designate allies from foes. Orange will predominantly be used when an action is related to the player character such as experience gain, or contextual interactions.
ColorRGBPurposeHostile Red255, 48, 0NegativeHealing Green140, 200, 60PositiveAllies Teal71, 230, 220Allied players

Workflow Tip: One strong workflow idea is to develop graphs or initial designs entirely in white, using opacity to design value hierarchy. Add hints of orange at the end to create focal points.


7. Text & Legibility
Typeface: Borda Family
WeightUsageBorda LightThin typeface, only useful when very large. Problematic when scaling in world.Borda RegularA light typeface, useful for large headers.Borda MediumThe most versatile typeface. Ideal for in-world scaling text, names and damage numbers.Borda HeavyA bolder alternative to Borda Medium, good to put emphasis on text. Can be scaled to the smallest size and still remain legible. Ideal for important numbers such as the HUD ammo and strong damage points.

NOTE: The idea behind the weights is to keep the overall thickness of the typeface within a close range for text of varying sizes. Light at very large and Bold at very small should have similar stroke thickness.

7.1 Volumetric Text
As 2D text is applied to a 3-dimensional space with a moving camera, challenges can arise in ensuring legibility:

Text at extreme angles becomes illegible (maximum tilt: ~35°)
Text sizes vary with distance
Backgrounds vary in color & value

Mandate: All UI elements should remain legible at 3–4 meters from the camera.
7.2 Text Layers & Treatment
Z-depth should be utilized to both enhance legibility and draw attention to important information.
Text Layers Breakdown — The text compound should be composed of three layers, each layer serving a purpose. The combined effect should enhance legibility and give a sense of 3D projection.
LayerNamePlacementAppearance1Main Text LayerProjected forwardWhite/Color (0.86 opacity)2Shadow Text LayerSlightly behind textDim Black (0.33 opacity)3Ghost Text LayerFar behindFaint White (0.11 opacity)
Layer 1 — Main Text Layer:
Color should be applied to text to give it certain context (e.g., damage numbers, contamination zones, or positive and negative values).
Layer 2 — Shadow Text Layer:
This layer enhances legibility by acting as a 'drop shadow' over light backgrounds, and should always be present.
Layer 3 — Ghost Text Layer:
Blurred backing enhances legibility over high contrast backgrounds, and should be used for important information (button interactions, mission-critical text).
Additional Backing Options:

Tinted Backing: Black (0.33 opacity) — should be used to help text appear over lighter backgrounds.
Color Backing: Color (0.66 opacity) — can be used to momentarily draw attention to information (e.g., XP gains).


NOTE: Because the UI uses colored tinting, colored text should be tinted with care. A separate BG Image node should contain a blur effect. A Contrast filter shader can be applied to enhance readability.


8. Shaders & VFX
Shaders can provide an important visual effect which enhances the look of the UI to a much more complex degree, by interacting with the world and in-game meshes (e.g., edge-tracing geometry, highlighting, screen effects).
The UI within The Division is a unique mixture of traditional information graphics and VFX.
A balanced combination of raw information graphics (crucial gameplay information through UI) and VFX (through shaders) will help make the visual impact feel integrated into the world.
Style: Shaders should resemble the UI art style as much as possible, following the previous visual elements and style guidelines: spatial, light and airy, minimal, flexible, temporary.
Glitching: Momentary glitching is a strong stylistic element of the shaders. Since they are so complex, the imperfection of the OS is more apparent and glitching should be seen occasionally (broken lines, offsetting, etc).

9. Iconography Style
9.1 Creating Icons
Icon design rules:

Monocolor white
Stylized simplification
No gradients
Legible at 5% screen size

Iconography is an important part of The Division to reduce the amount of text displayed in the world, HUD and menus. Symbols should be clear, immediately understandable, and easy to read at a small size.
Standard practice for clear icon design: ensure that fine lines are not too thin at small sizes, and the overall symbol feels like one solid form.

10. Camera
10.1 Character is King
The player is an invisible spectator, peeking at the character and their UI. Information should be visible to the camera, but always relative and angled towards the character.
Fixed UI — This UI has a soft connection, fixed to the camera, but made to look relative to the character. This kind of UI can ensure legibility for important information by being fixed on the screen, especially when navigation is needed.
Related camera modes: HUD, Megamap, Main Menu, Inventory, Loot.
In-World UI — This UI has a hard connection with an in-world location (bones, objects), but is oriented to ensure legibility for the camera. This kind of UI will move on the screen with collision, animation and aiming. This UI should consider mirroring left and right based on the character's cover position.
Camera Views:

¹ Soft vs Hard Connection — Connections relate UI to camera. In a soft connection, the camera will move with the UI and character.
